📰 News Headlines Web Scraper
==============================

📌 Overview:
This Python script scrapes top news headlines from a selected news website and saves them to a .txt file. It uses `requests` to fetch the HTML content and `BeautifulSoup` to parse and extract headline tags.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- Python 3.x
- requests
- beautifulsoup4

🚀 How to Run:
1. Install Dependencies:
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4

2. Run the Script:
   python news_scraper.py

3. Output:
   - A file named top_headlines.txt will be created in the same directory.
   - It contains a numbered list of extracted headlines.

🧠 How It Works:
- Sends an HTTP GET request to the news website.
- Parses the HTML using BeautifulSoup.
- Extracts text from <h2> and <h3> tags.
- Filters and saves the headlines to a .txt file.

🔧 Customization:
- To change the target website, modify the URL variable in the script.
- You can adjust the tags or classes used for headlines depending on the site’s structure.
